*Greeting!,
Currently, I am a Master's student working part-time as a research assistant in deep learning tasks (specifically, object detection) and as a backend developer, as well as taking an internship as an ML Engineer, but my ultimate goal is to be a HikkiNEET.*

*I'm interested (or perhaps more accurately, fascinated) in deep learning and neuroscience because I believe it's a good combination that can lead us to true intelligence.*
