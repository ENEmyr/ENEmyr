*Greeting!, Currently I'm a Master's student who works as a research assistant in deep learning tasks (more specific is about object detection) and backend developer in part-time and also taking an internship as ML Engineer,But my ultimate desire is to be a HikkiNEET.*

*I'm interested (to be straight call it fascinated might be more accurate) in deep learning and neuroscience because I thought it's a good combination that can lead us to the real intelligence.*
