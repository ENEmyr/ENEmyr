*Greeting!,
Right now, I'm a Master's student working part-time as a research assistant in deep learning tasks (specifically, object detection) and as a backend developer. I'm also doing an internship as an ML Engineer. My ultimate goal, though, is to be a HikkiNEET.*

*I'm really interested (or maybe more accurately, fascinated) in deep learning and neuroscience because I think it's a great combination that could lead us to true intelligence.*
